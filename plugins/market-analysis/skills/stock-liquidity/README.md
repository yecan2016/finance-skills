# Stock Liquidity Analysis

Analyze stock liquidity across multiple dimensions. A-share and Hong Kong securities use `ah-market-data` via the Hexin iFinD HTTP API; US/global Yahoo Finance-supported securities use yfinance data. Covers bid-ask spreads, volume profiles, order book depth estimates, market impact modeling, and turnover ratios.
