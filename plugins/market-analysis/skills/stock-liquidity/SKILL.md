  for A-share and Hong Kong securities, and yfinance for Yahoo Finance-supported US/global securities.
  Use this skill whenever the user asks about liquidity, trading costs, bid-ask spread,

  easy/hard it is to trade a stock without moving the price.
  Triggers: "how liquid is AAPL", "bid-ask spread", "volume analysis", "order book depth",

# Stock Liquidity Analysis Skill

Analyzes stock liquidity across multiple dimensions — bid-ask spreads, volume patterns, order book depth, estimated market impact, and turnover ratios — using data from Yahoo Finance via [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).

Liquidity matters because it determines the real cost of trading. The quoted price is not what you actually pay — spreads, slippage, and market impact all eat into returns, especially for larger positions or less liquid names.

For A-share and Hong Kong securities, use `ah-market-data` first. For US/global securities, use Yahoo Finance via yfinance.

**Important**: This is for research and educational purposes only. Not financial advice. yfinance is not affiliated with Yahoo, Inc.

---

## Step 1: Route A/H Requests First

If the target is an A-share or Hong Kong security, call `ah-market-data` before using yfinance.

Ask `ah-market-data` for:
- quote snapshot: last price, bid/ask if available, volume, turnover, timestamp
- historical OHLCV: at least 3 months daily data by default
- shares outstanding and free float if available
- market, board, sector, trading status, and any limit-up/limit-down or halt context

Then compute the same liquidity concepts using normalized fields:
- ADTV = average daily trading volume
- average daily turnover amount = close * volume or provider turnover field
- turnover ratio = average volume / float shares when float is available
- Amihud illiquidity = average absolute return / turnover amount
- market impact = square-root model using local currency turnover and volatility

For A/H output, state whether bid/ask, order book, or float data was unavailable from iFinD and avoid yfinance-specific delay caveats.

For non-A/H requests, continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Ensure Dependencies Are Available

**Current environment status:**

```
!`python3 -c "import yfinance, pandas, numpy; print(f'yfinance={yfinance.__version__} pandas={pandas.__version__} numpy={numpy.__version__}')" 2>/dev/null || echo "DEPS_MISSING"`
```

If `DEPS_MISSING`, install required packages:

```python
import subprocess, sys
subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-q", "yfinance", "pandas", "numpy"])
```

If already installed, skip and proceed.

---

## Step 3: Route to the Correct Sub-Skill

Classify the user's request and jump to the matching section. If the user asks for a general liquidity assessment without specifying a particular metric, run **Sub-Skill A** (Liquidity Dashboard) which computes all key metrics together.

| User Request | Route To | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| General liquidity check, "how liquid is X" | **Sub-Skill A: Liquidity Dashboard** | "how liquid is AAPL", "liquidity analysis for TSLA", "is this stock liquid enough" |
| Bid-ask spread, trading costs, effective spread | **Sub-Skill B: Spread Analysis** | "bid-ask spread for AMD", "what's the spread on NVDA options", "trading cost estimate" |
| Volume, ADTV, dollar volume, volume profile | **Sub-Skill C: Volume Analysis** | "volume analysis MSFT", "average daily volume", "volume profile for SPY" |
| Order book depth, market depth, level 2 | **Sub-Skill D: Order Book Depth** | "order book depth for AAPL", "market depth", "show me the book" |
| Market impact, slippage, execution cost for large orders | **Sub-Skill E: Market Impact** | "how much would 50k shares move the price", "slippage estimate", "market impact of $1M order" |
| Turnover ratio, trading activity relative to float | **Sub-Skill F: Turnover Ratio** | "turnover ratio for GME", "float turnover", "how actively traded is this" |
| Compare liquidity across multiple stocks | **Sub-Skill A** (multi-ticker mode) | "compare liquidity AAPL vs TSLA", "which is more liquid AMD or INTC" |

### Defaults

| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| Lookback period | `3mo` (3 months) |
| Data interval | `1d` (daily) |
| Market impact model | Square-root model |
| Intraday interval (when needed) | `5m` |

---

## Sub-Skill A: Liquidity Dashboard

**Goal**: Produce a comprehensive liquidity snapshot combining all key metrics for one or more tickers.

### A1: Fetch data and compute all metrics

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def liquidity_dashboard(ticker_symbol, period="3mo"):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    info = ticker.info
    hist = ticker.history(period=period)

    if hist.empty:
        return None

    # --- Spread metrics (from current quote) ---
    bid = info.get("bid", None)
    ask = info.get("ask", None)
    current_price = info.get("currentPrice") or info.get("regularMarketPrice") or hist["Close"].iloc[-1]

    spread = None
    spread_pct = None
    if bid and ask and bid > 0 and ask > 0:
        spread = round(ask - bid, 4)
        midpoint = (ask + bid) / 2
        spread_pct = round((spread / midpoint) * 100, 4)

    # --- Volume metrics ---
    avg_volume = hist["Volume"].mean()
    median_volume = hist["Volume"].median()
    avg_dollar_volume = (hist["Close"] * hist["Volume"]).mean()
    volume_std = hist["Volume"].std()
    volume_cv = volume_std / avg_volume if avg_volume > 0 else None  # coefficient of variation

    # --- Turnover ratio ---
    shares_outstanding = info.get("sharesOutstanding", None)
    float_shares = info.get("floatShares", None)
    base_shares = float_shares or shares_outstanding
    turnover_ratio = round(avg_volume / base_shares, 6) if base_shares else None

    # --- Amihud illiquidity ratio ---
    # Average of |daily return| / daily dollar volume
    returns = hist["Close"].pct_change().dropna()
    dollar_volume = (hist["Close"] * hist["Volume"]).iloc[1:]  # align with returns
    amihud_values = returns.abs() / dollar_volume
    amihud = amihud_values[amihud_values.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan).notna()].mean()

    # --- Market impact estimate (square-root model) ---
    # For a hypothetical order of 1% of ADV
    adv = avg_volume
    order_size = adv * 0.01
    daily_volatility = returns.std()
    sigma = daily_volatility
    participation_rate = order_size / adv if adv > 0 else 0
    impact_bps = sigma * np.sqrt(participation_rate) * 10000  # in basis points

    return {
        "ticker": ticker_symbol,
        "current_price": round(current_price, 2),
        "bid": bid,
        "ask": ask,
        "spread": spread,
        "spread_pct": spread_pct,
        "avg_daily_volume": int(avg_volume),
        "median_daily_volume": int(median_volume),
        "avg_dollar_volume": round(avg_dollar_volume, 0),
        "volume_cv": round(volume_cv, 3) if volume_cv else None,
        "shares_outstanding": shares_outstanding,
        "float_shares": float_shares,
        "turnover_ratio": turnover_ratio,
        "amihud_illiquidity": round(amihud * 1e9, 4) if not np.isnan(amihud) else None,
        "daily_volatility": round(daily_volatility * 100, 2),
        "impact_1pct_adv_bps": round(impact_bps, 2),
        "observations": len(hist),
    }
```

### A2: Interpret and present

Present as a summary card. For the Amihud illiquidity ratio, multiply by 1e9 for readability (standard convention).

**Liquidity grade** (use these rough thresholds for US equities):

| Grade | Avg Dollar Volume | Spread (%) | Amihud (×10⁹) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Very High | > $500M/day | < 0.03% | < 0.01 |
| High | $50M–$500M/day | 0.03–0.10% | 0.01–0.1 |
| Moderate | $5M–$50M/day | 0.10–0.50% | 0.1–1.0 |
| Low | $500K–$5M/day | 0.50–2.00% | 1.0–10 |
| Very Low | < $500K/day | > 2.00% | > 10 |

When comparing multiple tickers, show a side-by-side table and highlight which is more liquid and why.

## Sub-Skill B: Spread Analysis

**Goal**: Detailed bid-ask spread analysis including current spread, historical context from options data, and effective spread estimates.

### B1: Current spread from quote

```python
import yfinance as yf

def spread_analysis(ticker_symbol):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    info = ticker.info

    bid = info.get("bid", 0)
    ask = info.get("ask", 0)
    bid_size = info.get("bidSize", None)
    ask_size = info.get("askSize", None)
    current_price = info.get("currentPrice") or info.get("regularMarketPrice", 0)

    result = {"bid": bid, "ask": ask, "bid_size": bid_size, "ask_size": ask_size}

    if bid > 0 and ask > 0:
        midpoint = (bid + ask) / 2
        result["absolute_spread"] = round(ask - bid, 4)
        result["relative_spread_pct"] = round((ask - bid) / midpoint * 100, 4)
        result["relative_spread_bps"] = round((ask - bid) / midpoint * 10000, 2)
    return result
```

### B2: Options spread context

Options data from yfinance includes bid/ask for each strike, which gives a sense of derivatives liquidity. Use the nearest expiration, extract near-the-money calls and puts, and compute spread and spread percentage for each.

See `references/liquidity_reference.md` § "Options Spread Analysis" for the full code template.

### B3: Present results

Show:
- Current quoted spread (absolute, relative %, basis points)
- Bid/ask sizes if available
- Near-the-money options spreads for context
- How the spread compares to typical ranges for this market cap tier

---

## Sub-Skill C: Volume Analysis

**Goal**: Analyze trading volume patterns — averages, trends, relative volume, and dollar volume.

### C1: Compute volume metrics

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def volume_analysis(ticker_symbol, period="3mo"):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    hist = ticker.history(period=period)

    if hist.empty:
        return None

    vol = hist["Volume"]
    close = hist["Close"]
    dollar_vol = vol * close

    # Relative volume (today vs average)
    rvol = vol.iloc[-1] / vol.mean() if vol.mean() > 0 else None

    # Volume trend (linear regression slope over the period)
    x = np.arange(len(vol))
    slope, _ = np.polyfit(x, vol.values, 1) if len(vol) > 1 else (0, 0)
    trend_pct = (slope * len(vol)) / vol.mean() * 100  # % change over period

    # Volume profile by day of week
    hist_copy = hist.copy()
    hist_copy["DayOfWeek"] = hist_copy.index.dayofweek
    day_names = {0: "Mon", 1: "Tue", 2: "Wed", 3: "Thu", 4: "Fri"}
    vol_by_day = hist_copy.groupby("DayOfWeek")["Volume"].mean()
    vol_by_day.index = vol_by_day.index.map(day_names)

    # High/low volume days
    high_vol_days = hist.nlargest(5, "Volume")[["Close", "Volume"]]
    low_vol_days = hist.nsmallest(5, "Volume")[["Close", "Volume"]]

    return {
        "avg_volume": int(vol.mean()),
        "median_volume": int(vol.median()),
        "avg_dollar_volume": round(dollar_vol.mean(), 0),
        "current_volume": int(vol.iloc[-1]),
        "relative_volume": round(rvol, 2) if rvol else None,
        "volume_trend_pct": round(trend_pct, 1),
        "volume_by_day": vol_by_day.to_dict(),
        "high_vol_days": high_vol_days,
        "low_vol_days": low_vol_days,
        "max_volume": int(vol.max()),
        "min_volume": int(vol.min()),
    }
```

### C2: Present results

Show:
- Average daily volume (shares and dollar) with median for comparison
- Relative volume (RVOL) — today's volume vs. the average. RVOL > 1.5 is elevated; RVOL < 0.5 is unusually quiet
- Volume trend — is trading activity increasing or declining?
- Day-of-week pattern (if meaningful variation exists)
- Top 5 highest-volume days with context (earnings? news?)

---

## Sub-Skill D: Order Book Depth

**Goal**: Estimate order book depth using available bid/ask data from the equity quote and options chain.

Yahoo Finance does not provide full Level 2 / order book data. Be upfront about this limitation. What we can do:

1. **Equity quote**: bid, ask, bid size, ask size (top of book only)
2. **Options chain**: bid/ask and open interest across strikes give a proxy for derivatives depth
3. **Intraday volume distribution**: how volume is distributed within the day suggests how deep the continuous market is

### D1: Gather available depth data

Collect three data points:

1. **Top of book** — bid, ask, bidSize, askSize from `ticker.info`
2. **Intraday volume distribution** — 5-min bars over the last 5 days, grouped by time-of-day and normalized to percentage of daily volume
3. **Options open interest** — total call/put OI and volume from the nearest expiration as a derivatives depth proxy

See `references/liquidity_reference.md` § "Order Book Depth Proxy" for the full code template.

### D2: Present results

Show:
- **Top of book**: current bid/ask with sizes
- **Intraday volume shape**: where volume concentrates (open/close vs. midday)
- **Options depth**: total open interest and volume as a proxy for derivatives liquidity
- **Honest limitation**: "Yahoo Finance provides top-of-book only. For full Level 2 depth, a direct market data feed (e.g., NYSE OpenBook, NASDAQ TotalView) is needed."

---

## Sub-Skill E: Market Impact

**Goal**: Estimate how much a given order size would move the price, using the square-root market impact model.

The standard model in practice is: **Impact (%) = σ × √(Q / V)** where σ is daily volatility, Q is order size in shares, and V is average daily volume. This is a simplified version of the Almgren-Chriss framework used by institutional traders.

### E1: Compute market impact estimate

```python
import yfinance as yf
import numpy as np

def market_impact(ticker_symbol, order_shares=None, order_dollars=None, period="3mo"):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    hist = ticker.history(period=period)
    info = ticker.info

    if hist.empty:
        return None

    current_price = info.get("currentPrice") or hist["Close"].iloc[-1]
    avg_volume = hist["Volume"].mean()
    daily_volatility = hist["Close"].pct_change().dropna().std()

    # Determine order size in shares
    if order_dollars and not order_shares:
        order_shares = order_dollars / current_price
    elif not order_shares:
        # Default: estimate for various sizes
        order_shares = avg_volume * 0.01  # 1% of ADV

    participation_rate = order_shares / avg_volume if avg_volume > 0 else 0
    pct_adv = (order_shares / avg_volume * 100) if avg_volume > 0 else 0

    # Square-root impact model
    impact_pct = daily_volatility * np.sqrt(participation_rate) * 100
    impact_bps = impact_pct * 100
    impact_dollars = impact_pct / 100 * current_price * order_shares

    # Generate impact curve for multiple order sizes
    sizes = [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50]  # as fraction of ADV
    curve = []
    for s in sizes:
        q = avg_volume * s
        imp = daily_volatility * np.sqrt(s) * 100
        curve.append({
            "pct_adv": round(s * 100, 1),
            "shares": int(q),
            "dollars": round(q * current_price, 0),
            "impact_bps": round(imp * 100, 1),
            "impact_dollars_per_share": round(imp / 100 * current_price, 4),
        })

    return {
        "ticker": ticker_symbol,
        "current_price": round(current_price, 2),
        "avg_daily_volume": int(avg_volume),
        "daily_volatility_pct": round(daily_volatility * 100, 2),
        "order_shares": int(order_shares),
        "order_dollars": round(order_shares * current_price, 0),
        "pct_of_adv": round(pct_adv, 2),
        "estimated_impact_bps": round(impact_bps, 1),
        "estimated_impact_pct": round(impact_pct, 4),
        "estimated_impact_total_dollars": round(impact_dollars, 2),
        "impact_curve": curve,
    }
```

### E2: Present results

Show:
- The estimated impact for the user's specific order size
- An impact curve table showing how cost scales with order size
- Context: "This uses the square-root market impact model, a standard institutional estimate. Actual impact depends on execution strategy (VWAP, TWAP, etc.), time of day, and current market conditions."
- If impact > 50 bps, flag that the order is large relative to liquidity and suggest the user consider algorithmic execution or splitting the order across days

---

## Sub-Skill F: Turnover Ratio

**Goal**: Measure how actively a stock trades relative to its shares outstanding and free float.

### F1: Compute turnover metrics

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def turnover_analysis(ticker_symbol, period="3mo"):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    hist = ticker.history(period=period)
    info = ticker.info

    if hist.empty:
        return None

    avg_volume = hist["Volume"].mean()
    shares_outstanding = info.get("sharesOutstanding")
    float_shares = info.get("floatShares")

    result = {
        "avg_daily_volume": int(avg_volume),
        "shares_outstanding": shares_outstanding,
        "float_shares": float_shares,
    }

    if shares_outstanding:
        daily_turnover = avg_volume / shares_outstanding
        result["daily_turnover_ratio"] = round(daily_turnover, 6)
        result["annualized_turnover"] = round(daily_turnover * 252, 2)
        result["days_to_trade_float"] = round(
            (float_shares or shares_outstanding) / avg_volume, 1
        ) if avg_volume > 0 else None

    if float_shares:
        float_turnover = avg_volume / float_shares
        result["float_turnover_daily"] = round(float_turnover, 6)
        result["float_turnover_annualized"] = round(float_turnover * 252, 2)

    # Turnover trend
    vol = hist["Volume"]
    base = float_shares or shares_outstanding
    if base:
        hist_copy = hist.copy()
        hist_copy["turnover"] = hist_copy["Volume"] / base
        recent_turnover = hist_copy["turnover"].tail(20).mean()
        older_turnover = hist_copy["turnover"].head(20).mean()
        if older_turnover > 0:
            result["turnover_trend_pct"] = round(
                (recent_turnover - older_turnover) / older_turnover * 100, 1
            )

    return result
```

### F2: Present results

Show:
- Daily and annualized turnover ratios (vs. outstanding and float)
- "Days to trade the float" — how many days at average volume to turn over the entire free float
- Turnover trend — is the stock becoming more or less actively traded?
- Context:

| Turnover (Annualized) | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| > 500% | Extremely active — likely speculative or momentum-driven |
| 100–500% | Actively traded |
| 30–100% | Moderate activity |
| < 30% | Thinly traded — likely institutional buy-and-hold or neglected |

---

## Step 4: Respond to the User

After running the appropriate sub-skill:

### Always include

- The **lookback period** used for historical metrics
- The **data timestamp** — spreads and quotes are snapshots, not real-time
- Any tickers that returned **empty data** (invalid symbol, delisted, etc.)
- The **data source**: Hexin iFinD HTTP API for A/H securities, or Yahoo Finance/yfinance for Yahoo-sourced securities

### Always caveat

- Yahoo Finance quote data has a **15-minute delay** for most exchanges — spreads shown may not reflect the current live market
- Full order book (Level 2) data is **not available** through Yahoo Finance
- Market impact estimates are **models, not guarantees** — actual execution costs depend on strategy, timing, and market conditions
- Liquidity can **change rapidly** — a stock that's liquid today may not be tomorrow (especially around events, halts, or during extended hours)

### Practical guidance (mention when relevant)

- **Position sizing**: If estimated impact exceeds 25 bps, the position may be too large for the stock's liquidity
- **Small/micro-cap warning**: Stocks with < $1M daily dollar volume require careful execution
- **Spread costs compound**: A 0.10% spread on a round-trip (buy + sell) costs 0.20% — this adds up for active strategies
- **Illiquidity premium**: Less liquid stocks historically earn higher returns as compensation — but the transaction costs can eat this premium

**Important**: Never recommend specific trades. Present liquidity data and let the user make their own decisions.
