  Fetch financial and market data using the yfinance Python library for US/global
  Yahoo Finance-supported securities, and route A-share/Hong Kong market requests
  to the ah-market-data skill backed by Hexin iFinD MCP.
  Use this skill whenever the user asks for stock prices, historical data, financial statements,
  options chains, dividends, earnings, analyst recommendations, or any market data.
  Triggers include: any mention of stock price, ticker symbol (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, etc.),
  A/H stock requests that need routing to ah-market-data, Chinese tickers such as
  600519.SH, 000001.SZ, 00700.HK, Chinese company names, A股, 港股, H股,
  "get me the financials", "show earnings", "what's the price of", "download stock data",
  "options chain", "dividend history", "balance sheet", "income statement", "cash flow",
  "analyst targets", "institutional holders", "compare stocks", "screen for stocks",
  or any request involving Yahoo Finance data.
  Always use this skill even if the user only provides a ticker — infer intent from context.

# Market Data Routing Skill

Fetches financial and market data. For A-share and Hong Kong securities, use `ah-market-data` via Hexin iFinD MCP first. For US/global Yahoo Finance-supported securities, use [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).

**Important**: yfinance is not affiliated with Yahoo, Inc. Data is for research and educational purposes.

## Step 1: Route A/H Requests First

Before importing or installing yfinance, check whether the request is about A-share or Hong Kong market data.

Use `ah-market-data` when the request includes:
- A-share codes such as `600519.SH`, `000001.SZ`, `688981.SH`, or plain six-digit Chinese stock codes
- Hong Kong codes such as `00700.HK`, `0700.HK`, `9988.HK`
- Chinese security/company names such as 贵州茅台, 平安银行, 腾讯控股
- A股, 港股, H股, 沪深300, 恒生指数, 北向资金, 南向资金
- Chinese funds, ETFs, macro series, announcements, or Chinese market news

For A/H requests, call `ah-market-data` and ask it for the needed normalized fields. Do not install yfinance unless the A/H MCP data is unavailable and the user explicitly accepts a fallback with likely coverage gaps.

For all other tickers and Yahoo Finance-supported symbols, continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Ensure yfinance Is Available

**Current environment status:**

```
!`python3 -c "import yfinance; print('yfinance ' + yfinance.__version__ + ' installed')" 2>/dev/null || echo "YFINANCE_NOT_INSTALLED"`
```

If `YFINANCE_NOT_INSTALLED`, install it before running any code:

```python
import subprocess, sys
subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-q", "yfinance"])
```

If yfinance is already installed, skip the install step and proceed directly.

## Step 3: Identify What the User Needs

Match the user's request to one or more data categories below, then use the corresponding code from `references/api_reference.md`.

| User Request | Data Category | Primary Method |
|---|---|---|
| Stock price, quote | Current price | `ticker.info` or `ticker.fast_info` |
| Price history, chart data | Historical OHLCV | `ticker.history()` or `yf.download()` |
| Balance sheet | Financial statements | `ticker.balance_sheet` |
| Income statement, revenue | Financial statements | `ticker.income_stmt` |
| Cash flow | Financial statements | `ticker.cashflow` |
| Dividends | Corporate actions | `ticker.dividends` |
| Stock splits | Corporate actions | `ticker.splits` |
| Options chain, calls, puts | Options data | `ticker.option_chain()` |
| Earnings, EPS | Analysis | `ticker.earnings_history` |
| Analyst price targets | Analysis | `ticker.analyst_price_targets` |
| Recommendations, ratings | Analysis | `ticker.recommendations` |
| Upgrades/downgrades | Analysis | `ticker.upgrades_downgrades` |
| Institutional holders | Ownership | `ticker.institutional_holders` |
| Insider transactions | Ownership | `ticker.insider_transactions` |
| Company overview, sector | General info | `ticker.info` |
| Compare multiple stocks | Bulk download | `yf.download()` |
| Screen/filter stocks | Screener | `yf.Screener` + `yf.EquityQuery` |
| Sector/industry data | Market data | `yf.Sector` / `yf.Industry` |
| News | News | `ticker.news` |

## Step 4: Write and Execute the Code

### General pattern

```python
import subprocess, sys
subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-q", "yfinance"])

import yfinance as yf

ticker = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
# ... use the appropriate method from the reference
```

### Key rules

1. **Always wrap in try/except** — Yahoo Finance may rate-limit or return empty data
2. **Use `yf.download()` for multi-ticker comparisons** — it's faster with multi-threading
3. **For options, list expiration dates first** with `ticker.options` before calling `ticker.option_chain(date)`
4. **For quarterly data**, use `quarterly_` prefix: `ticker.quarterly_income_stmt`, `ticker.quarterly_balance_sheet`, `ticker.quarterly_cashflow`
5. **For large date ranges**, be mindful of intraday limits — 1m data only goes back ~7 days, 1h data ~730 days
6. **Print DataFrames clearly** — use `.to_string()` or `.to_markdown()` for readability, or select key columns
7. **Timezone handling** — yfinance returns tz-aware datetime indices (e.g., `America/New_York`). When comparing dates, always use `pd.Timestamp(..., tz=...)` or strip timezones with `.tz_localize(None)`. See the reference file for details.

### Valid periods and intervals

| Periods | `1d`, `5d`, `1mo`, `3mo`, `6mo`, `1y`, `2y`, `5y`, `10y`, `ytd`, `max` |
|---|---|
| **Intervals** | `1m`, `2m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `60m`, `90m`, `1h`, `1d`, `5d`, `1wk`, `1mo`, `3mo` |

---

## Step 5: Present the Data

After fetching data, present it clearly:

1. **Summarize key numbers** in a brief text response (current price, market cap, P/E, etc.)
2. **Show tabular data** formatted for readability — use markdown tables or formatted DataFrames
3. **Highlight notable items** — earnings beats/misses, unusual volume, dividend changes
4. **Provide context** — compare to sector averages, historical ranges, or analyst consensus when relevant

If the user seems to want a chart or visualization, combine with an appropriate visualization approach (e.g., generate an HTML chart or describe the trend).

Always state the data source: Hexin iFinD MCP for A/H data, or Yahoo Finance/yfinance for Yahoo-sourced data.
