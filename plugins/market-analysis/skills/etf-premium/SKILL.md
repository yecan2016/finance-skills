# ETF Premium/Discount Analysis Skill

Calculates the premium or discount of an ETF's market price relative to its Net Asset Value (NAV). For Chinese mainland and Hong Kong funds/ETFs, use `ah-market-data` via the Hexin iFinD HTTP API. For US/global ETFs, use Yahoo Finance data via [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).

**Why this matters:** An ETF's market price can diverge from the value of its underlying holdings (NAV). When you buy at a premium, you're overpaying relative to the assets; at a discount, you're getting a bargain. This divergence is typically small for liquid US equity ETFs but can be significant for bond ETFs, international ETFs, leveraged/inverse products, and crypto ETFs — especially during periods of market stress.

**Important**: For research and educational purposes only. Not financial advice. yfinance is not affiliated with Yahoo, Inc.

---

## Step 1: Route A/H Fund And ETF Requests First

If the target is a Chinese mainland or Hong Kong fund/ETF, use `ah-market-data` before yfinance. Ask for market price, latest NAV/IOPV if available, premium/discount, turnover, volume, holdings, fund category, fund manager, and timestamp.

For A/H ETFs, state:
- market price currency
- NAV currency and date
- whether NAV is same-day, prior-day, estimated, or intraday IOPV
- whether the premium/discount may be stale because NAV updates after market close

For non-A/H ETF requests, continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Ensure Dependencies Are Available

**Current environment status:**

```
!`python3 -c "import yfinance, pandas, numpy; print(f'yfinance={yfinance.__version__} pandas={pandas.__version__} numpy={numpy.__version__}')" 2>/dev/null || echo "DEPS_MISSING"`
```

If `DEPS_MISSING`, install required packages:

```python
import subprocess, sys
subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-q", "yfinance", "pandas", "numpy"])
```

If already installed, skip and proceed.

---

## Step 3: Route to the Correct Sub-Skill

Classify the user's request and jump to the matching section. If the user asks a general question about an ETF's premium or discount without specifying a particular analysis type, default to **Sub-Skill A** (Single ETF Snapshot).

| User Request | Route To | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Single ETF premium/discount | **Sub-Skill A: Single ETF Snapshot** | "is SPY at a premium?", "AGG premium to NAV", "BITO premium" |
| Compare multiple ETFs | **Sub-Skill B: Multi-ETF Comparison** | "compare bond ETF discounts", "which has bigger premium IBIT or BITO", "rank these ETFs by premium" |
| Screener / find extreme premiums | **Sub-Skill C: Premium Screener** | "which ETFs have biggest discount", "find ETFs trading below NAV", "premium screener" |
| Deep analysis with context | **Sub-Skill D: Premium Deep Dive** | "why is HYG at a discount", "is ARKK premium normal", "ETF premium analysis with context" |

### Defaults

| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| Data source | yfinance `navPrice` field |
| Price field | `regularMarketPrice` (falls back to `previousClose`) |
| Screener universe | Common ETF list by category (see Sub-Skill C) |

---

## Sub-Skill A: Single ETF Snapshot

**Goal**: Show the current premium/discount for one ETF with context about what's normal, plus a peer comparison to show how it stacks up against similar ETFs.

### A1: Fetch and compute

```python
import yfinance as yf

# Peer groups by category — used to automatically compare the target ETF against its closest peers
CATEGORY_PEERS = {
    "Digital Assets": ["IBIT", "BITO", "FBTC", "ETHA", "ARKB", "GBTC"],
    "Intermediate Core Bond": ["AGG", "BND", "SCHZ"],
    "High Yield Bond": ["HYG", "JNK", "USHY"],
    "Long Government": ["TLT", "VGLT", "SPTL"],
    "Emerging Markets Bond": ["EMB", "VWOB", "PCY"],
    "Large Growth": ["QQQ", "VUG", "IWF", "SCHG"],
    "Large Blend": ["SPY", "VOO", "IVV", "VTI"],
    "Commodities Focused": ["GLD", "IAU", "SLV", "DBC"],
    "China Region": ["KWEB", "FXI", "MCHI"],
    "Trading--Leveraged Equity": ["TQQQ", "UPRO", "SOXL", "JNUG"],
    "Trading--Inverse Equity": ["SQQQ", "SPXU", "SOXS", "JDST"],
    "Derivative Income": ["JEPI", "JEPQ", "QYLD"],
    "Large Value": ["SCHD", "VYM", "DVY", "HDV"],
}

def etf_premium_snapshot(ticker_symbol):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    info = ticker.info

    # Verify this is an ETF
    quote_type = info.get("quoteType", "")
    if quote_type != "ETF":
        return {"error": f"{ticker_symbol} is not an ETF (quoteType={quote_type})"}

    price = info.get("regularMarketPrice") or info.get("previousClose")
    nav = info.get("navPrice")

    if not price or not nav or nav <= 0:
        return {"error": f"NAV data not available for {ticker_symbol}"}

    premium_pct = (price - nav) / nav * 100
    premium_dollar = price - nav

    # Additional context
    result = {
        "ticker": ticker_symbol,
        "name": info.get("longName") or info.get("shortName", ""),
        "market_price": round(price, 4),
        "nav": round(nav, 4),
        "premium_discount_pct": round(premium_pct, 4),
        "premium_discount_dollar": round(premium_dollar, 4),
        "status": "PREMIUM" if premium_pct > 0 else "DISCOUNT" if premium_pct < 0 else "AT NAV",
        "category": info.get("category", "N/A"),
        "fund_family": info.get("fundFamily", "N/A"),
        "total_assets": info.get("totalAssets"),
        "net_expense_ratio": info.get("netExpenseRatio"),
        "avg_volume": info.get("averageVolume"),
        "bid": info.get("bid"),
        "ask": info.get("ask"),
        "yield_pct": info.get("yield"),
        "ytd_return": info.get("ytdReturn"),
    }

    # Bid-ask spread as context for whether the premium is meaningful
    bid = info.get("bid")
    ask = info.get("ask")
    if bid and ask and bid > 0:
        spread_pct = (ask - bid) / ((ask + bid) / 2) * 100
        result["bid_ask_spread_pct"] = round(spread_pct, 4)

    return result
```

### A2: Fetch peer comparison

After computing the target ETF's snapshot, look up its `category` and pull premium data for peers in the same category. This gives the user immediate context on whether the premium is ETF-specific or market-wide.

```python
def get_peer_premiums(target_ticker, target_category):
    """Fetch premium/discount for peers in the same category."""
    peers = CATEGORY_PEERS.get(target_category, [])
    # Remove the target itself from peers
    peers = [p for p in peers if p.upper() != target_ticker.upper()]
    if not peers:
        return []

    peer_data = []
    for sym in peers:
        try:
            t = yf.Ticker(sym)
            info = t.info
            p = info.get("regularMarketPrice") or info.get("previousClose")
            n = info.get("navPrice")
            if p and n and n > 0:
                prem = (p - n) / n * 100
                peer_data.append({
                    "ticker": sym,
                    "name": info.get("shortName", ""),
                    "price": round(p, 2),
                    "nav": round(n, 2),
                    "premium_pct": round(prem, 4),
                    "expense_ratio": info.get("netExpenseRatio"),
                })
        except Exception:
            pass
    return peer_data
```

Present the peer comparison as a small table after the main snapshot. This helps the user see whether the premium is unique to their ETF or shared across the category — for example, if all crypto ETFs are at ~1.5% premium, the user's ETF isn't an outlier.

### A3: Interpret the result

Use this framework to explain whether the premium/discount is meaningful:

| Premium/Discount | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Within +/- 0.05% | Essentially at NAV — normal for large, liquid ETFs |
| +/- 0.05% to 0.25% | Minor deviation — common and usually not actionable |
| +/- 0.25% to 1.0% | Notable — worth mentioning. Check bid-ask spread and category |
| +/- 1.0% to 3.0% | Significant — common for less liquid, international, or specialty ETFs |
| Beyond +/- 3.0% | Large — may indicate stress, illiquidity, or structural issues |

**Context matters by category:**
- **US large-cap equity** (SPY, QQQ, IVV): premiums > 0.10% are unusual
- **Bond ETFs** (AGG, HYG, LQD, TLT): discounts of 0.5-2% happen during volatility
- **International/EM** (EEM, VWO, KWEB): time-zone mismatch causes regular 0.3-1% deviations
- **Leveraged/Inverse** (TQQQ, SQQQ, JNUG): 0.3-1.5% is normal due to daily reset mechanics
- **Crypto** (IBIT, BITO): 1-3% premiums are common, especially for newer funds
- **Commodity** (GLD, USO, UNG): depends on contango/backwardation in futures

Also compare the premium/discount to the **bid-ask spread**: if the premium is smaller than the spread, it's noise, not signal.

---

## Sub-Skill B: Multi-ETF Comparison

**Goal**: Compare premium/discount across multiple ETFs side by side.

### B1: Fetch and rank

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def compare_etf_premiums(tickers):
    rows = []
    for sym in tickers:
        try:
            t = yf.Ticker(sym)
            info = t.info
            if info.get("quoteType") != "ETF":
                rows.append({"ticker": sym, "error": "Not an ETF"})
                continue
            price = info.get("regularMarketPrice") or info.get("previousClose")
            nav = info.get("navPrice")
            if price and nav and nav > 0:
                prem = (price - nav) / nav * 100
                bid = info.get("bid", 0)
                ask = info.get("ask", 0)
                spread = (ask - bid) / ((ask + bid) / 2) * 100 if bid and ask and bid > 0 else None
                rows.append({
                    "ticker": sym,
                    "name": info.get("shortName", ""),
                    "price": round(price, 2),
                    "nav": round(nav, 2),
                    "premium_pct": round(prem, 4),
                    "spread_pct": round(spread, 4) if spread else None,
                    "category": info.get("category", "N/A"),
                    "total_assets": info.get("totalAssets"),
                })
            else:
                rows.append({"ticker": sym, "error": "NAV unavailable"})
        except Exception as e:
            rows.append({"ticker": sym, "error": str(e)})

    df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
    if "premium_pct" in df.columns:
        df = df.sort_values("premium_pct", ascending=True)
    return df
```

### B2: Present as a ranked table

Sort by premium/discount (most discounted first). Highlight:
- Which ETFs are at the deepest discount
- Which are at the highest premium
- Whether the premium/discount exceeds the bid-ask spread (if it doesn't, it's market microstructure noise)

---

## Sub-Skill C: Premium Screener

**Goal**: Scan a universe of common ETFs to find those with the largest premiums or discounts.

### C1: Define the universe and scan

Use this default universe organized by category. The user can supply their own list instead.

```python
DEFAULT_ETF_UNIVERSE = {
    "US Equity": ["SPY", "QQQ", "IVV", "VOO", "VTI", "DIA", "IWM", "ARKK"],
    "Bond": ["AGG", "BND", "TLT", "HYG", "LQD", "VCIT", "VCSH", "BNDX", "EMB", "JNK", "MUB", "TIP"],
    "International": ["EFA", "EEM", "VWO", "IEMG", "KWEB", "FXI", "INDA", "VEA", "EWZ", "EWJ"],
    "Commodity": ["GLD", "SLV", "USO", "UNG", "DBC", "IAU", "PDBC", "GSG"],
    "Crypto": ["IBIT", "BITO", "FBTC", "ETHA", "ARKB", "GBTC"],
    "Leveraged/Inverse": ["TQQQ", "SQQQ", "SPXU", "UPRO", "JNUG", "JDST", "SOXL", "SOXS"],
    "Sector": ["XLF", "XLE", "XLK", "XLV", "XLI", "XLP", "XLU", "XLRE", "XLC", "XLB", "XLY"],
    "Sector - Semis/Tech": ["SOXX", "SMH", "IGV", "XSD"],
    "Sector - Healthcare": ["XBI", "IBB", "IHI"],
    "Thematic": ["ARKW", "ARKG", "HACK", "CLOU", "WCLD", "BUG", "BOTZ", "LIT", "ICLN", "TAN"],
    "Income": ["JEPI", "JEPQ", "SCHD", "VYM", "DVY", "DIVO", "HDV", "QYLD"],
}

import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def screen_etf_premiums(universe=None, min_abs_premium=0.0):
    if universe is None:
        universe = DEFAULT_ETF_UNIVERSE

    all_tickers = []
    for category, tickers in universe.items():
        for sym in tickers:
            all_tickers.append((sym, category))

    rows = []
    for sym, category_label in all_tickers:
        try:
            t = yf.Ticker(sym)
            info = t.info
            price = info.get("regularMarketPrice") or info.get("previousClose")
            nav = info.get("navPrice")
            if price and nav and nav > 0:
                prem = (price - nav) / nav * 100
                if abs(prem) >= min_abs_premium:
                    rows.append({
                        "ticker": sym,
                        "name": info.get("shortName", ""),
                        "category": category_label,
                        "price": round(price, 2),
                        "nav": round(nav, 2),
                        "premium_pct": round(prem, 4),
                        "total_assets_B": round(info.get("totalAssets", 0) / 1e9, 2),
                        "expense_ratio": info.get("netExpenseRatio"),
                    })
        except Exception:
            pass

    df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
    if not df.empty:
        df = df.sort_values("premium_pct", ascending=True)
    return df
```

### C2: Present the results

Show a ranked table sorted by premium (most discounted first). Group by category if the list is long. Call out:
- **Top 5 deepest discounts** — potential buying opportunities (or signs of stress)
- **Top 5 highest premiums** — overpaying risk
- **Category patterns** — are all bond ETFs at a discount? Are all crypto ETFs at a premium?

Note: this screener takes time because it fetches data one ticker at a time. For large universes (60+ ETFs), warn the user it may take 1-2 minutes.

---

## Sub-Skill D: Premium Deep Dive

**Goal**: Combine premium/discount data with additional context to help the user understand *why* the premium exists and whether it's likely to persist.

### D1: Gather comprehensive data

Run the Sub-Skill A snapshot, then add:

```python
import yfinance as yf
import numpy as np

def premium_deep_dive(ticker_symbol):
    ticker = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    info = ticker.info

    price = info.get("regularMarketPrice") or info.get("previousClose")
    nav = info.get("navPrice")
    if not price or not nav or nav <= 0:
        return {"error": "NAV data not available"}

    premium_pct = (price - nav) / nav * 100

    # Historical price data for volatility context
    hist = ticker.history(period="3mo")
    if not hist.empty:
        returns = hist["Close"].pct_change().dropna()
        daily_vol = returns.std()
        annualized_vol = daily_vol * np.sqrt(252)
        avg_volume = hist["Volume"].mean()
        dollar_volume = (hist["Close"] * hist["Volume"]).mean()

        # Price range context
        high_3m = hist["Close"].max()
        low_3m = hist["Close"].min()
        pct_from_high = (price - high_3m) / high_3m * 100
    else:
        daily_vol = annualized_vol = avg_volume = dollar_volume = None
        high_3m = low_3m = pct_from_high = None

    result = {
        "ticker": ticker_symbol,
        "name": info.get("longName", ""),
        "price": round(price, 4),
        "nav": round(nav, 4),
        "premium_pct": round(premium_pct, 4),
        "category": info.get("category", "N/A"),
        "fund_family": info.get("fundFamily", "N/A"),
        "total_assets": info.get("totalAssets"),
        "expense_ratio": info.get("netExpenseRatio"),
        "yield_pct": info.get("yield"),
        "ytd_return": info.get("ytdReturn"),
        "beta_3y": info.get("beta3Year"),
        "annualized_vol": round(annualized_vol * 100, 2) if annualized_vol else None,
        "avg_daily_dollar_volume": round(dollar_volume, 0) if dollar_volume else None,
        "pct_from_3m_high": round(pct_from_high, 2) if pct_from_high else None,
    }

    # Bid-ask spread
    bid = info.get("bid")
    ask = info.get("ask")
    if bid and ask and bid > 0:
        spread_pct = (ask - bid) / ((ask + bid) / 2) * 100
        result["bid_ask_spread_pct"] = round(spread_pct, 4)
        result["premium_exceeds_spread"] = abs(premium_pct) > spread_pct

    return result
```

### D2: Explain the *why*

After gathering data, explain the premium/discount using this diagnostic framework:

**Common causes of premiums:**
- **Demand surge** — more buyers than authorized participants can create shares (common for new/hot ETFs like crypto)
- **Time-zone mismatch** — international ETF trading when underlying markets are closed; price reflects anticipated moves
- **Creation mechanism bottleneck** — when authorized participants face constraints on creating new shares
- **Sentiment premium** — retail demand pushes price above fair value during hype cycles

**Common causes of discounts:**
- **Liquidity stress** — during sell-offs, bond and credit ETFs often trade at discounts because underlying bonds are harder to price/trade than the ETF itself
- **Redemption pressure** — heavy outflows but slow authorized participant response
- **Stale NAV** — the official NAV may not reflect after-hours news or events
- **Structural issues** — contango in futures-based ETFs (USO, UNG) creates persistent drag

**Is the premium likely to persist?**
- For liquid US equity ETFs: No — arbitrage corrects deviations within minutes
- For bond ETFs during stress: Discounts can persist for days or weeks
- For crypto ETFs: Premiums tend to narrow as the fund matures and APs become more active
- For international ETFs: Resets daily as underlying markets open

---

## Step 3: Respond to the User

### Always include
- The **ETF name and ticker**
- **Market price** and **NAV** with the calculation shown
- **Premium/discount percentage** clearly labeled
- **Context**: is this deviation normal for this ETF category?

### Always caveat
- NAV data from Yahoo Finance reflects the **most recent official NAV** (typically end of prior trading day) — it is not real-time
- Market price may have a **15-minute delay** depending on the exchange
- Premium/discount can change rapidly during market hours — this is a snapshot, not a live feed
- Small premiums/discounts (< bid-ask spread) are **market microstructure noise**, not real mispricing
- **Never recommend buying or selling** based on premium/discount alone — present the data and let the user decide

### Formatting
- Use markdown tables for multi-ETF comparisons
- Show the formula: `Premium/Discount = (Market Price - NAV) / NAV x 100`
- Use color indicators in text: "trading at a **0.45% discount**" or "at a **1.2% premium**"
- Round percentages to 2-4 decimal places depending on magnitude
