# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

A collection of agent skills for financial analysis and trading, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Skills are installable into Codex, Codex.ai, and other supported agents (Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, etc.).

## Repository structure

This repo is both a Codex plugin marketplace and an Agent Skills repository. Skills are organized into plugin groups by usage.

## How skills work

Each skill is a self-contained directory under `plugins/<group>/skills/`. The `SKILL.md` file is what Codex reads at runtime — it tells the model when to activate, what steps to follow, and where to find reference details.

### SKILL.md format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: >
  Multi-line description that doubles as the trigger definition.
  Include specific phrases, keywords, and scenarios that should activate this skill.
---

# Skill Title

Step-by-step instructions organized as ## Step N sections.
Tables, code blocks, and formulas as needed.

## Reference Files

- `references/foo.md` — description
```

**Required frontmatter fields:** `name`, `description`

The `description` field is critical — it controls when the skill activates. Write it as a comprehensive trigger list, not a summary.

### Reference files

Markdown documents in `references/` containing detailed API references, code templates, formulas, or schema docs. The SKILL.md instructions tell the model to read specific reference files when needed, keeping the main instructions concise.

## Creating a new skill

1. Choose the appropriate plugin group (`market-analysis`, `social-readers`, `data-providers`, or `startup-tools`)
2. Create `plugins/<group>/skills/<skill-name>/` directory
3. Write `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and step-by-step instructions
4. Add reference files under `references/` for detailed API docs, code templates, or formulas that would bloat the main instructions
5. Add a `README.md` for the skill's GitHub page (description, triggers, platform, setup, reference file list)
6. Update the root `README.md` to list the new skill in the appropriate plugin group table
7. The skill will be auto-zipped and released on tag push via GitHub Actions

### Platform considerations

Skills that require shell access, network calls, or external binaries (e.g., twitter-cli, pip install) only work on **CLI-based agents** like Codex. They do **not** work on Codex.ai, which runs in a sandboxed environment that restricts network access and binaries.

Skills that only use Codex's built-in tools (e.g., `show_widget` for generative-ui) work on **Codex.ai**.

### Dynamic content with `!`command``

Skills can embed shell commands that Codex executes at skill invocation time, injecting the output inline. Use this for runtime environment checks (tool installation status, auth state, live data). Syntax: wrap in a fenced code block with `` !`command` ``.

Example — checking if a CLI tool is installed and authenticated:
```
!`(command -v mytool && mytool status 2>&1 | head -5 && echo "AUTH_OK" || echo "AUTH_NEEDED") 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"`
```

Guidelines:
- Use for environment/auth checks so the model skips install/auth steps when unnecessary
- Use for injecting live data (e.g., current stock prices) to replace hardcoded values
- Keep commands fast (< 2s) — they run synchronously before the skill loads
- Always include fallback output (e.g., `|| echo "UNAVAILABLE"`) so the skill degrades gracefully
- Only works on CLI-based agents (Codex) — Codex.ai ignores these

### Instruction style guidelines

- Organize as numbered steps (## Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- Use tables to map user intents to actions/methods
- Include defaults for missing parameters so the skill works with partial input
- Put lengthy code templates and API references in `references/` files, not inline
- End with a "Respond to the User" step describing how to present results

## Plugin system

This repo ships as a Codex plugin marketplace containing 6 plugins:

| Plugin | Description |
|---|---|
| `finance-market-analysis` | Stock analysis, earnings, correlations, options via yfinance |
| `finance-social-readers` | Social media research feeds (Twitter, Discord, LinkedIn, Telegram, YC) |
| `finance-data-providers` | External API data (Adanos, Funda AI, Hormuz Strait) |
| `finance-startup-tools` | Startup analysis frameworks |
| `finance-ui-tools` | Generative UI design system for Codex widgets |
| `finance-skill-creator` | Skill authoring, evaluation, and improvement |

- `.Codex-plugin/marketplace.json` — marketplace listing with all 6 plugin entries.
- `plugins/<group>/plugin.json` — per-plugin manifest (name, version, keywords). Skills under `plugins/<group>/skills/` with SKILL.md frontmatter are auto-discovered by the plugin loader.
- `.agents/` — auto-generated mirror for agent distribution. **Do not edit directly** — this is produced from `plugins/` content.

Users install all plugins via `npx plugins add himself65/finance-skills`. Individual plugins can be installed via `npx plugins add himself65/finance-skills --plugin <plugin-name>`. Individual skills can be installed via `npx skills add himself65/finance-skills --skill <name>`.

When a skill is invoked as a plugin, it is namespaced as `<plugin-name>:<skill-name>` (e.g., `/finance-market-analysis:options-payoff`).

## CI/CD

- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release-skills.yml`): On tag push (`v*`), zips each skill from `plugins/*/skills/*/` and publishes them as a GitHub release. These zips can be uploaded to Codex.ai for web/desktop users.
- **Lint workflow** (`.github/workflows/skill-lint.yml`): Lints all `SKILL.md` files across all plugin groups.

## Important constraints

- **No trade execution.** All brokerage-related skills must be read-only. Never allow AI to execute trades.
- This is a documentation/reference repository — no build system, no tests. Quality comes from clear, accurate skill instructions.
